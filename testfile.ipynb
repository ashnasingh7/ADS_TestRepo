    "*Previous evidence suggests that mindfulness training may improve aspects of psychosocial well-being. Whilst mindfulness is traditionally taught in person, consumers are increasingly turning to mindfulness-based smartphone apps as an alternative delivery medium for training. Despite this growing trend, few studies have explored whether mindfulness delivered via a smartphone app can enhance psychosocial well-being within the general public. The present pilot randomized controlled trial compared the impact of engaging with the self-guided mindfulness meditation (MM) app ‘Headspace’ for a period of 10 or 30 days, to a waitlist (WL) control, using a cohort of adults from the general population. The Satisfaction with Life Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Wagnild Resilience Scale were administered online at baseline and after 10 and 30 days of the intervention.

    "> There is controversy over whether it is appropriate to treat Likert scale data as continuous, because a Likert scale technically consists of ordered categories. It does not make sense to model Likert data with a mean, because the mode could be used to figure out the most common answer. Assigning values to scale points and finding the mean could result in a value that does not correspond to a specific Likert scale point. Also, intervals between scale values cannot always be considered equal."

The 10-item scale aims to establish how unpredictable, uncontrollable and overloaded respondents’ find their lives with respect to the previous month. Respondents answer questions about their feelings and thoughts using a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never to 4 = very often). Scores range from 0–40 with higher scores indicating more stress. The scale has high test-retest reliability (α = .85) and its validity with other measures ranges from .52-.76.” What type of validity are the authors referring to when they say, “validity with other measures ranges from .52-.76”?

    "> Both groups had very similar baseline scores for all three measures. For SWLS it was 24.17 (app) and 24.55 (waitlist). For PSS it was 16.90 (app) and 17.73 (waitlist). For RWS it was 73.69 (app) and 75 (waitlist). If these scores were substantially different it would not be an issue when it comes to data analysis, because you could still calculate the difference between baseline and 10 or 30 day scores. However, the scores being different can create a confound. If the scores for the experimental group are already very high compared to the control group it could limit the effect of Headspace on mindfulness. This would limit the generalizability of the results and how much comparison can be done between the two groups, because the app's effect has not been tested on people at average levels psychosocial well-being."

    "> The spread of change in stress is medium with the range being between -15 and 15. Most people perceived a decrease in stress between 0 and 5, no change in perceived stress, or an increase in perceived stress between 0 and 4 points. The median change in stress perception was at a decrease of 2 points. There were three particpants who saw a very large decrease in stress compared to the other participants. This distribution shows that over the study almost half experienced an decrease in stress while the rest experienced an increase. This could be better analyzed by faceting by `Group`."
